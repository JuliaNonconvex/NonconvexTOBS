# NonconvexTOBS

The method of topological optimization of binary structures ([TOBS](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168874X17305619?via%3Dihub)) was originally developed in the context of optimal distribution of material in mechanical components. This package generalizes the heuristic to mixed integer nonlinear programming problems.
